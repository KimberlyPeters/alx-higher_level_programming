# Higher-level programming - Python

This repository contains programs written for the Higher-level programming track at the ALX Software Engineering Program. In these projects, I learnt Python, and I also made use of concepts learnt. Simultaneously, I continued to reinforce and expand my skills in C and shell scripting. The specific list of projects contained follows:

* [0x00. Python - Hello, World](https://github.com/KimberlyPeters/alx-higher_level_programming/tree/master/0x00-python-hello_world)
* [0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions](https://github.com/KimberlyPeters/alx-higher_level_programming/tree/master/0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions)
* [0x02. Python - import & modules](https://github.com/KimberlyPeters/alx-higher_level_programming/tree/master/0x02-python-import_modules)
